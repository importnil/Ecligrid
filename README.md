# Ecligrid
Flexible Mobile First Grid System Based on Flexbox.


##Features
- Easy to get started and use, yet feature-rich thanks to powerful Flexbox
- Supports both X & Y axis
- Mobile first approach
- Responsive by default
- Plenty of utility classes
- Only 6.5KB minified & gzipped
- It's magic!

##Basic Usage
Coming soon.

##Documentation
Coming soon.

##Notes
Ecligrid comes with utility classes (offsets, paddings, etc.) and basic CSS reset.
These can be manually omitted, thus significantly reducing the file size.
