# Ecligrid
Flexible Mobile First Grid System Based on Flexbox.

**Ecligrid is production ready**. It is widely used in public projects and can be used in your next project, if you don't care about ancient browsers and possible IE10-11 (not Edge) bugs.

At the time of writing this, global support of the flex property (as stated by [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=flex)) is **95.74%** (77.48% fully supported and 18.25% partially supported, which is primarily because of certain IE bugs).

[List of known IE 10-11 issues](http://caniuse.com/#search=flex).

## Features
- Easy to get started and use, yet feature-rich thanks to powerful Flexbox
- Supports both X & Y axis
- Mobile first approach
- Responsive by default
- Plenty of utility classes
- **Only 6.5KB minified & gzipped**

## Basic Usage
Coming soon.

## Documentation
Coming soon.

## Notes
Ecligrid comes with utility classes (offsets, paddings, etc.) and basic CSS reset.
These can be manually omitted, thus significantly reducing the file size.
